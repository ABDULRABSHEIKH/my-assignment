            <p class="para1">Established in May 1999 by famous spiritual and religious scholar Maulana Bashir Ahmed
                Farooqui, Saylani Welfare International Trust was built on the fundamentals of breaking the cycle of
                poverty, alleviating the financial troubles of the poor, giving people a chance to live a dignified life
                and spreading happiness.<br><br><br>

                We are an organization that believes in lighting up the lives of underprivileged people across the
                world. We endeavor to provide the best quality services in areas including food, education, medical and
                social welfare free of cost to people living in the dark. With over 60 different sectors, we feed
                thousands of hungry people each day, hundreds more are given the hope of life through medical health
                care, many are educated to become leaders of tomorrow and several are given the opportunity to stand on
                their feet financially. <br><br><br>

                Today, we are proud to say that our physical presence extends throughout Pakistan with a vast network of
                125 branches operating in major cities including Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad and
                Faisalabad. Apart from Pakistan, we have overseas offices in the UK, USA and UAE as well. Our worldwide
                branches are operating under the guidance of a team of over 2,000 working professionals who help almost
                125,000 people on a daily basis.

                <br><br><br><br> We strongly believe that a little help goes a long way and our work would not be
                possible without the generous support of our valuable donors. Our local and international donors have
                graciously lent us a hand by supporting our causes and enabling us to serve the needs of people in need.
